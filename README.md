**Your agent is an investment. Signet is where its value accumulates.**

Signet is a persistent cognition layer for AI agents. It gives your
agent memory that works the way memory actually works — ambient,
automatic, and not dependent on the agent deciding to remember.
Your agent doesn't call a "save memory" tool. It doesn't search a
database when it needs context. Signet extracts knowledge after
sessions, builds a knowledge graph, and injects the right context
before every prompt. The agent just has its memory. Like you have yours.

Everything runs locally. You own the data. The agent is yours.

Why Signet
===

Your agent starts every session from zero. It doesn't know what you
worked on yesterday. It doesn't know your preferences, your projects,
or the decisions you've already made together. Every session is a
first date.

The industry's answer to this has been to give agents memory tools —
"remember this," "recall that." That's not memory. That's a filing
cabinet the agent sometimes opens. It puts the LLM in charge of
deciding what's important, when to store it, and when to retrieve it.
This isn't how memory works for humans. You don't query a database to
remember your coworker's name. It surfaces because it's relevant.

Signet takes a fundamentally different approach. The agent is not in
the loop. A distillation engine extracts structured insights from
every session after it ends — no tool calls, no agent involvement.
A knowledge graph maps how those insights connect. And a predictive
model, trained on your interaction patterns, injects the right context
before every prompt — before the agent asks.

Your agent doesn't manage its memory. It just has it.

The same agent follows you across Claude Code, OpenCode, and
OpenClaw. Same personality, same knowledge, same secrets. Switch
tools without starting over.

How it works
===

### The distillation layer

At the end of every conversation, Signet reviews the session and
distills it. Not "save the transcript" — *distill*. A local LLM
breaks the conversation into atomic facts, checks them against
what's already known, and decides: file as new, update something
existing, replace something outdated, or skip entirely. Your agent
won't store "prefers dark mode" fourteen times. It recognizes the
insight already exists and moves on.

</p>

### The knowledge graph

Named entities — people, projects, tools, concepts — are extracted
and linked. When you ask about a project, Signet doesn't just find
text that sounds related. It traverses the graph: the project's
architecture, the people involved, the tools it depends on, the
constraints that apply. Context arrives structured, not as a pile of
fragments hoping something useful is in there.

</p>

### The predictive scorer

Most memory systems wait for queries. Signet anticipates them.

A neural network trained on your interaction patterns runs alongside
the LLM at inference time. It observes the conversation context and
predicts which memories will be needed — before the agent asks,
before a search is triggered. Entity weights in the knowledge graph
inform traversal, so the system doesn't just find text that looks
similar — it walks the relationships that matter.

The scorer is unique to each user. Your weights never leave your
machine. With consent, anonymized training signals from the community
feed a shared base model that ships with every install — so your
agent starts smart on day one, then gets smarter for you specifically.
Federated learning applied to agent memory. Nobody else has this data.

### Retrieval

Retrieval blends graph traversal, keyword search, and semantic
similarity into a single ranked result. The constellation view in the
dashboard lets you see your agent's knowledge topology — what's
connected, what's isolated, what's central.

### Document ingest

Feed any document into the distillation layer. PDFs, specs, reference
pages, URLs. They're chunked, embedded, and indexed alongside your
agent's insights. Point Signet at a codebase's docs and they become
part of what your agent knows.

### Safety guarantees

- **Raw-first**: content is persisted before any LLM processing begins
- **Pinned insights are sacred**: the distillation layer cannot modify
  them. Only you can.
- **Everything is recoverable**: deletions are soft, with a 30-day
  recovery window and full audit trail

Install
===

```bash
bun add -g signetai        # or: npm install -g signetai 
signet setup               # interactive setup wizard
```

The wizard initializes `~/.agents/` (or configure your own directory),
configures your selected harnesses, sets up an embedding provider 
(Native/Ollama/OpenAI), creates the database, and starts the daemon.

### Tell your agent to install it

Paste this to your AI agent:

```
Install and fully configure Signet AI by following this guide exactly: https://signetai.sh/skill.md
```

### Use it

```bash
signet status              # check daemon health
signet dashboard           # open the web UI

signet remember "prefers bun over npm"
signet recall "coding preferences"
```

In connected harnesses, skills work directly:

```text
/remember critical: never commit secrets to git
/recall release process
```

What Signet is building
===

If OpenClaw is the operating system for AI agents, Signet is
the home directory. The place where identity, knowledge, skills,
and secrets persist between sessions, between platforms, between
reboots. An OS without persistent storage isn't an OS. Signet is
that storage.

Signet is a protocol, not just a product. The reference implementation
is the proof that the protocol works. Here's the full picture:

### Identity

Portable agent identity in plain files at `~/.agents/` by default.
Instructions, personality, user profile, working knowledge — 
all inspectable, version-controlled, and synced across harnesses 
automatically. Your agent's identity is not locked inside any 
vendor's platform.

```text
~/.agents/
  agent.yaml        # manifest + runtime config
  AGENTS.md         # operating instructions
  SOUL.md           # personality + voice
  IDENTITY.md       # structured identity
  USER.md           # operator profile
  MEMORY.md         # synthesized working knowledge
  skills/           # installed capabilities
  .secrets/         # encrypted secret store
```

### Insights, not observations

Other tools store observations — raw text thrown into a vector
database and retrieved by cosine distance. Signet distills
observations into insights: structured facts organized into a
knowledge graph with entities, aspects, attributes, and dependency
edges. The difference is the difference between a pile of sticky
notes and an actual understanding of the domain.

And critically — the agent doesn't do this. The distillation engine
does. No memory tools cluttering the agent's context window. No
reliance on the LLM deciding what's worth keeping. The extraction
happens outside the session, the injection happens before the prompt.
Your agent focuses on the work. Signet handles the rest.

### Trust and security

Secrets are libsodium-encrypted at rest. Your agent can use secrets
without ever reading their values — Signet injects them into
subprocess environments and redacts them from captured output. Auth
supports local-only, token-based, and hybrid modes with role-based
access control.

The distillation layer runs on a local Ollama model by default.
Nothing leaves your machine unless you configure it to.

### The protocol layer

Signet defines how agents should carry identity, how knowledge should
be structured, and how trust should be established. The spec is open.
The implementation is open. The goal is a standard that any tool can
adopt — not a walled garden that locks you in.
